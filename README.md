Additionally, Omar ###PyBer Analysis

*Purpose of the New Analysis:

Omar was presented a new assignment from V. Visualized to code in Python with Pandas to create a summary DataFrame. The purpose of Pyber Analysis was to indicate how the data compares and contrasts by city type and the disparity in the data which can diversify decision-makers within at Pyber and be utilized for a updated analysis. Omar based the written summary report from his data using Python and Panda to describe the ride-sharing data by city type with a muli-line graph that indicated the "Total Fare by city Type" from the months of January to April. 

*Results:

Omar reviewed the data results from the summary Date Frame to determine the differences in ride-sharing data among various cities from the three regions, Urban, Suburban and Rural cities. As you can view in the below sample Suburban, Urban and Rural tables which differentiates by the ride id, fare, and divers count for each city in the three regions. is extensively moderate in the sample provided compared to that of the Rural cities. In the rural area the sample provided rural fare was extensively higher in certain cities such as Michealberg with the fare of $54.85 and Lake Latoyabury $51.81. Whereas in the Urban communities the sample indicated South Jack shows $34.58 and Port Samanthamouth record fare was $33.44. Overall, a disparity in their fares were siggnificant according to the sample of the top five cities in Urban, Suburban and Rural cities.
Another comparison that Omar reflected on was the driver count within the three regions demonstrated in the tables. The leading city driver count for the Urban area cities were in the lead South Miichelleport with a driver count of 72, then a dip to 57 drivers counts by Port Samanthamouth. Trailing behind in third place was South Jacks with a 46-driver count, to follow Rodnetfourt 34 and Lake Jonathanshire driver count 5. One indicator to the success was the fare was moderately priced. This is represented in the table last two columns below.

  As Omar reviewed the total rides for each of the cities based on topography, urban, suburban and rural for the total rides by city. He calculated that the Urban cities total rides were 1,625, suburban cities rides were 625, rural cities were 125 in total respectively. He then calculated the total drivers for each city type. He found the correlation to the rides and total drivers were similar in ranking, urban cities had 66 total drivers, suburban 36 and the rural region 18 total drives. You can review the tables to see the marginal differences in rides. 
  Next, Omar calculated the total fare for each of the three types to be compared by the fare. In the urban cities the total fare was 39,854.38 which was significantly higher than the suburban of 19,356.33 and rural cities 4,327.93. Them Omar created form the data provided the average fare per ride for each of the regions. The average fare in the Rural cities were 34.623440 moderately higher than both the suburban 30.970128 and 24.525772 respectively as noted in the tables.

Additionally, he showed the average fare per driver in each of the three regions, urban cities generated 603.85 which paralleled the higher total rides total drivers and total fare to implicate higher overall statistics. Secondly was the suburban cities total average fare per driver received 537.68 and lastly the rural cities average fare per driver was 240.44 which was on the lower spectrum. This is indicated in the last column.

  Another part of the assignment was based on the average fare per ride for the Rural cities it was 34.623440 which was the highest correlated to suburban with 30.970128 and urban with 24.525772 the lowest. The average fare per driver in the rural area was the least amount 18, secondly suburban area 36 and final the urban cities was 66.  
  
  Omar's team wanted to determine the fare sum by the three types of city regions rural, suburban, and urban by date in the year 2019 from January to April. 
They realized that the Rural area fare sum was generated only once for 43.69; suburban cities achieved four times the amounts of 47.74,24.07,25,56 and 31.15. Finally urban cities matched four sum fares of 37.91, 7.57, 10.75, 5.42, 12.31 as you can see in the table below for the rides that were take on January 1st, 2019, for the various three regions. He was able to capture this information using a pivot table.

Rural, Suburban, and urban table for the four months provide a sample to the activity for the three regional types. As you can see the rural area had no activity, suburban and urban were active with rides and generating a fare.

The weekly fare from January to April 2019 provided a clear overview for the three type cities.

In the multi-line graph that Omar created to depicted as a visual for the "Total Fare by City Type", x axis represents the fare dollars (USD) by the range of 0 to 2,500. The months were January to April of the year 2019. The key is city types which is represented by the green line for urban; suburban represented by the orange color line and lastly the blue line is the rural cities.

***Business recommendations:

It is suggested for the three disparities among the Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities based on the overview of analysis in order to keep cost down and the drivers and rides conducive to a higher overhead they would require to review their weekly fare in the rural cities due to the lower rides but highest fare. In the Urban cities it would be recommended due to being the leading city driver count for the Urban area cities were in the lead South Miichelleport with a driver count of 72, then a dip to 57 drivers count by Port Samanthamouth. One indicator to the success was the fare was moderately priced so it should continue the momentum and review any cities that may require an overview to increase rides, drives with a moderate cost in mind. The rural cities with the lower driver and ride count should review their operational service of marketing in those two areas with the mindset that if they increase the price, they possible would have lower fares similarly to that of the suburban cities. showed the average fare per driver in each of the three regions, urban cities generated 603.85 which paralleled the higher total rides total drivers and total fare to implicate higher overall statistics. Secondly was the suburban cities total average fare per driver received 537.68 and lastly the rural cities average fare per driver was 240.44 which was on the lower spectrum.
